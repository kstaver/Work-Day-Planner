						Work Day Planner API

This website is built to store your schedule in an easy to use online planner. Your entries will be safely saved in the cloud, so even if you accidently refresh the page, your schedule will be uneffected as long as you have clicked the cloud upload button on the right of your entries.

This planner coves a normal work day schedule, from 9:00am to 7:00pm. It will provide a visual update as the day goes on so that you know what the previous, present, and future events are at a glance. The color gray indicates that the time and event has passed. The color red stand for the present time, so any events you schedule within that hour will be what should be happening during that time. Finally, the color green represents any events that will happen in the future based on your current time.

As an added bonus, I have included a date and time function that display the current date and time in real time so you will always know what time and day it is.

If you have nay questions or find that the webpage has stopped working, please feel free to contact me. Thank you.
